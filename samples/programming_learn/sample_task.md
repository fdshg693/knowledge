# Sample Programming Learn Task

This demonstrates how to structure a simple programming learning request.

## Task Format

**Concept**: Async/Await Programming  
**Audience**: Intermediate developers  
**Language**: JavaScript
**Context**: Web development and data processing

I want to understand how async/await works under the hood, practical differences from promises, and error handling best practices. Please include real-world examples for API calls and file I/O operations.

## Alternative Example

**Concept**: Graph Algorithms  
**Audience**: CS students  
**Language**: Python
**Context**: Algorithm interviews

Explain graph representation techniques (adjacency list vs matrix) and implement common algorithms like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm with practical examples.
